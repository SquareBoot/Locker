# Locker
A program that can be started after the login to lock the computer until a user writes his name.
Then the name is sent to a server which will log it.
It simply works. No way to escape from the lock screen in Windows (explorer is killed), but even on Linux that's hard (you will have to log in a tty and kill it).
